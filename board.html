                    <h3>Eddie Abbott- Member
</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                      Born and raised in Norfolk, VA, Eddie went directly into the workforce. While working on his college degree, he worked for a independent oil producer before joining BP. In 1991 Eddie relocated to Houston and managed the day to day marine operations for BP Marine, responsible for providing marine fuels and lubricants to vessels calling ports worldwide. Eddie left BP in 2003 and went back to school, receiving his degree in 2007.

                      2015 brought a change of events and Eddie became guardian of 1 yr. old granddaughter, Paisley. Eddie, Paisley and partner Linda relocated to Pagosa Springs in late 2016. This life change has magnified Eddie’s focus on early childhood education and the need for consistent resources in rural communities.
