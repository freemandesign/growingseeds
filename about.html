            <h2 class="section-heading">Who are we?</h2>
            <p>
Seeds of Learning is a stand-alone, not for profit, NAEYC accredited early care and education center, located in Pagosa Springs, Colorado. We serve preschoolers ages 2 1/2 through age 5. As a community based facility, we encompass parenting classes, educational opportunities for our families and other early childhood professionals, and participate in community outreach projects.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Our Mission</h2>
<p>
  Seeds of Learning empowers and inspires a diverse population of young children, nurturing lifelong learning as they become successful adults.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Philosophy</h2>
<p>
  Warm, supportive and respectful relationships between adults and children lie at the heart of excellent care and education for children.  It is our aspiration to work closely with parents to meet the social, emotional, physical and cognitive needs of each child, thereby instilling a love of learning, secure attachment, self-awareness and self-confidence.  We also partner with families so they feel respected, supported and nurtured in their parenting and child rearing efforts.  We acknowledge the fact that children, families and staff exist within an environment of individual cultures which are overlapping, differ greatly, and deserve tremendous respect.

  Authentic and reciprocal relationships with the children, their families and staff are at the heart of our relationship-based educational programs at Seeds of Learning.  We believe early care and education centers can and must be a place where children, families and staff alike can feel a sense of belonging.

  The Seeds of Learning philosophy encompasses high quality early care and education which includes the Incredible Years Dinosaur School, Creative Curriculum curricula offered to all children, and the Incredible Years Parenting class.  We encourage participation from our entire Seeds family.</p>

<p>
  Creative Curriculum was chosen for Seeds because it is based on the latest research on how children learn best and has been shown through experimental and quasi-experimental studies to improve classroom quality and promote the school readiness of preschool children. Creative Curriculum meets all of the standards put forth for effective early childhood curricula by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). Equally important, evaluation research provides strong evidence that the Creative Curriculum for Preschool improves classroom quality and promotes positive physical, social and cognitive outcomes for children.

  The Environmental Rating Scales are designed to assess “process quality” in an early childhood or school age care group. Process quality consists of the various interactions that go on in a classroom between staff and children, staff and parents, among the children themselves, as well as the interactions children have with the many materials and activities in the environment. The established reliability and validity of the Environmental Rating Scale make it particularly useful for research and program evaluation. It should be noted that ECERS (Early Childhood Environmental Rating Scale) is used as comprehensive quality measures in the National Child Care Staffing Study (Whitebook, Howes, & Phillips, 1989) and the Cost, Quality, and Child Outcomes Study (1995), the major studies of their time.

  The Incredible Years, our award-winning parent training, teacher training, and child social skills training approaches have been selected by the U.S. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention as an “exemplary” best practice program and as a “Blueprints” program. The Incredible Years Dinosaur School used in the preschool classrooms promotes social, emotional, and academic competence in children as well as increases children’s social skills, children’s understanding of feelings and children’s conflict management skills.

  Children will experience growth and learning in their social-emotional, physical, language and cognitive development as a result of observations and assessments taken through these programs. Families will feel included and supported in their own child-rearing as they participate in their child’s learning experience at Seeds of Learning.
