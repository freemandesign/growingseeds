Personal Philosophy:

Quality child care not only includes excellent care, education and parent education, health and safety but a relationship between each child and their family. I acknowledge the fact that every child is unique and individual, comes from their own culture, and deserves respect in regard to that culture. We can truly prove our love for a child and their family by respecting their culture. As Prime Times says, “Child care can’t be good for children without being good for parents and caregivers.” Warm, supportive and respectful relationships between adults and children lie at the heart of good care for children. I believe early care and education centers can and must be a place where children, parents and caregivers alike can feel a sense of belonging, like they’re family. Healthy children and healthy families make healthy communities.</p>
